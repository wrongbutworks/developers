# longbridge industry-peers

Explore the hierarchical sub-sector tree for an industry group. Takes a BK counter ID from [`industry-rank`](./industry-rank) and expands it into a full competitive landscape — sub-sectors, their sub-sectors, and the stocks in each.

## Basic Usage

```bash
longbridge industry-peers BK/US/IN00258
```

```
Root: Semiconductors (US)

├── Design & Fabless  23 stocks  +3.12%  YTD +18.4%
│   ├── GPU & AI Chips  8 stocks  +4.91%  YTD +24.1%
│   ├── Mobile SoC  6 stocks  +2.33%  YTD +12.8%
│   └── Analog IC  9 stocks  +1.54%  YTD +9.3%
├── Foundry & Manufacturing  7 stocks  +2.87%  YTD +15.6%

```

## Examples

### Explore a sector from industry-rank

```bash
# Step 1: find a sector
longbridge industry-rank --market US

# Step 2: drill into it using the counter_id column
longbridge industry-peers BK/US/IN00258
```

### HK sector tree

```bash
longbridge industry-peers BK/HK/IN00012
```

Works the same way across markets — use counter IDs from `industry-rank --market HK`, `--market CN`, or `--market SG`.

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format json` | Output raw JSON |

## Notes

- Counter IDs follow the format `BK/<MARKET>/IN<NUMBER>` — copy them directly from `industry-rank` output
- Each node shows stock count, daily change, and YTD change
