# longbridge industry-rank

Rank all industries in a market by a chosen indicator — see which sectors are leading today, which have the strongest revenue growth, or which are attracting the most capital.

## Basic Usage

```bash
longbridge industry-rank --market US
```

```
| rank | name                                    | counter_id      | chg    | indicator |
|------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1    | Semiconductors                          | BK/US/IN00258   | +3.82% | ...       |
| 2    | Software - Infrastructure               | BK/US/IN00305   | +2.91% | ...       |
| 3    | Biotechnology                           | BK/US/IN00043   | +2.54% | ...       |
| 4    | Electronic Components                   | BK/US/IN00099   | +1.98% | ...       |
| 5    | Asset Management                        | BK/US/IN00033   | +1.73% | ...       |
```

The `counter_id` column (e.g. `BK/US/IN00258`) can be passed directly to [`industry-peers`](./industry-peers) to explore the competitive tree within that sector.

## Examples

### Leading industries today

```bash
longbridge industry-rank --market US
```

Ranks industries by daily price performance. Replace `US` with `HK`, `CN`, or `SG` to switch markets.

### Top industries by market cap

```bash
longbridge industry-rank --market HK --indicator market-cap
```

### Top industries by revenue growth

```bash
longbridge industry-rank --market CN --indicator revenue-growth
```

### Then drill into a sector

```bash
# Get the counter_id from industry-rank, then explore its sub-sectors
longbridge industry-peers BK/US/IN00258
```
