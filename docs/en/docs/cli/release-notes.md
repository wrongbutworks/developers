# Release Notes

### [v0.22.4](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.22.4)

- **`constituent` now supports ETFs** — ETF symbols return an asset-allocation breakdown (holdings / regional / asset-class / industry tables); index symbols behave exactly as before
- **Full US ETF holdings from SEC N-PORT** — for US ETFs, `constituent` fetches the complete portfolio from SEC EDGAR N-PORT filings by default (weight, shares, market value — e.g. all 500+ holdings of `IVV.US`); falls back to the platform's asset-allocation summary when SEC data is unavailable

### [v0.22.3](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.22.3)

- **`quote` now includes the US overnight session** — `quote <SYMBOL> --format json` now populates `overnight_quote` alongside `pre_market_quote` and `post_market_quote`; previously the overnight field was always `null`, skewing after-close analysis in AI workflows
- **Account-type banner on holdings commands** — `positions`, `fund-positions`, `assets`, and `portfolio` now print a one-line banner (`Live A/C (real account)` / `Demo A/C (simulated account)`) before the table, so it's clear which account the data belongs to; `--format json` output is unchanged

### [v0.22.2](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.22.2)

- **JSON timestamps now RFC 3339** — time-series and history commands (`kline`, `kline-history`, `trades`, `intraday`, `capital-flow`, `capital-dist`, `market-temp`, `topics`) and account P&L flows now output ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 datetimes instead of raw Unix epochs
- **`market-temp --history` default range** — omitting `--start` now defaults to 30 days before the end date instead of today, so a single `--history` call returns a full month of data

### [v0.22.0](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.22.0)

- **New `shareholder --top`** — Top-20 major shareholders (institutions, individuals, insiders) with multi-period comparison; `--object-id <id>` for single shareholder holding history and trade details
- **Extended `short-positions`** — Added HK market support (`.HK` suffix auto-routes to HKEX short-position data)
- **New `short-trades`** — Daily short sale volume (US: FINRA/NASDAQ; HK: HKEX disclosure data)
- **New `compare`** — Multi-stock valuation comparison (PE/PB/PS/market-cap/close); server auto-selects peers when no comparison symbols given
- **New `top-movers`** — Stocks whose price movement exceeds the 20-day standard deviation, with correlated news; supports `--market`, `--sort time|change|hot`
- **New `screener` command group** — Stock screener: `strategies` (recommended/saved), `search --strategy-id <id>` or `--filter key:min:max`, `indicators` to list available filters
- **New `rank`** — Popularity leaderboard; list all categories without `--key`, or pass `--key <key>` for a specific ranking (e.g. `ib_hot_all-us`)
- MCP server updated with the same new tools

### [v0.21.0](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.21.0)

- **New: `business-segments`** — revenue breakdown by business segment, current period or historical trend
- **New: `industry-rank`** — industry ranking by market (US/HK/CN/SG) and indicator; counter_id output feeds directly into `industry-peers`
- **New: `industry-peers`** — hierarchical sub-sector tree with stock count, daily change, and YTD change per node
- **New: `financial-report snapshot`** — AI earnings summary with beat/miss analysis vs consensus estimates and upcoming peer earnings dates
- **New: `institution-rating --views`** — month-by-month buy/hold/sell distribution timeline

### [v0.20.3](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.20.3)

- **Breaking: `analyst-estimates` removed** — command has been removed; the same data is available via `consensus` (EPS and revenue estimates)
- **Fix: HK symbol leading zeros** — inputs like `00700.HK` or `09988.HK` now correctly resolve to `700.HK` / `9988.HK`; `operating` updated to reflect HK-only data coverage
- **Fix: `ipo detail`** — auto-detects market from symbol suffix (`SUJA.US` → US, `700.HK` → HK), so `--market` is no longer required; cleaner error message when no IPO data is found; Payment Deadline formatted as RFC 3339

### [v0.20.2](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.20.2)

- **Fix: `institution-rating --history`** — restructured as a proper table with logical column ordering; timestamps formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`; price targets rounded to 2 decimal places; `evaluate_history` capped to 20 most recent records
- **Fix: IPO date display** — `ipo listed`, `ipo wait-listing`, `ipo calendar`, `ipo us-wait-listing` now show correct dates (e.g. `2026-05-11`) instead of a bogus 1970 date

### [v0.20.0](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.20.0)

- **`ipo` command group** — comprehensive IPO tools: `subscriptions`, `wait-listing`, `listed`, `calendar`, `detail`, `orders`, `profit-loss` for HK market; `us-subscriptions`, `us-wait-listing`, `us-listed` for US market; `orders detail <id>` for full order detail
- **`financial-statement`** — detailed, hierarchical financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) with full line-item breakdown and YoY comparison; supports `--kind IS/BS/CF/ALL` and `--report af/saf/qf/cumul`
- **`financial-report --latest`** — new flag to fetch the latest report summary (key indicators: revenue, net profit, EPS, ROE, total assets) without fetching the full statement
- **`valuation-rank`** — daily PE/PB/PS industry percentile rank over a date range, showing `rank/total` for each metric
- **`institution-rating --history` / `--industry-rank`** — new flags: `--history` shows how analyst ratings and price targets have changed over time; `--industry-rank` ranks all stocks in the same industry by analyst coverage
- **`news search` / `topic search`** — keyword search across news articles and community topics
- **`bank-cards`** — list bank cards linked to your account
- **`withdrawals`** / **`deposits`** — view withdrawal and deposit history with date formatting and optional state/currency filters
- **`portfolio short-margin`** — short-selling margin deposit details per position
- **Fix: paper-trading account channel** — `auth status` and quote mall QR links now correctly reflect the account channel for paper-trading accounts (`lb_papertrading`), resolved from the access token JWT rather than hardcoded

### [v0.19.2](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.19.2)

- **`finance-calendar` revamp** — restructured into subcommands (`report`, `dividend`, `split`, `ipo`, `macrodata`, `closed`); new `--filter watchlist|positions` scopes events to your watchlist or holdings
- **`quote`** — new "Last Chg%" column showing price change vs previous close
- **`corp-action`** — defaults to 30 items; add `--all` to retrieve all records

### [v0.19.0](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.19.0)

- **TUI: History orders tab** — press `Tab` on the Orders page to switch between Today and History; History mode fetches the last 30 days by default; press `f` to open a date-range filter popup
- **TUI: Cancel and modify orders** — press `c` to cancel or `m` to modify an active today order directly from the orders table; a confirmation step is shown before submitting
- **`auth status` quote packages** — displays a formatted table of subscribed quote packages (market, name, validity period) and prints a QR code to open the quote mall in the Longbridge App
- **`calc-index` field aliases** — short aliases for common fields: `iv` (implied_volatility), `oi` (open_interest), `vol` (volume), `mktcap` (total_market_value), `exp` (expiry_date), `strike` (strike_price); `--help` now groups fields into General and Options/Warrants sections
- **`quant run` command** — run a quant indicator script server-side against historical K-line data; supply the script inline with `--script` or pipe via stdin; outputs computed plot values as JSON
- **`update` release notes** — only the 10 most recent entries are shown after `longbridge update` completes; `sudo` is suggested when the binary lives in `/usr/local/bin`

### [v0.18.0](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.18.0)

- **TUI: Orders page** — interactive orders table with trading shortcuts and an order entry dialog for placing trades without leaving the terminal
- **`dividend --page` / `--year`** — paginate through large dividend histories and filter by year; fetches 50 records per page (up from 30)

### [v0.17.4](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.17.4)

- **`--limit` alias for `--count`** — all commands that accept `--count` now also accept `--limit` as an alias, improving compatibility for AI agent tool-calling
- **Fix: Unix self-update ETXTBUSY** — `longbridge update` no longer fails with "Text file busy" on Unix; the update now uses a staged temp file and atomic rename instead of writing directly to the running binary

### [v0.17.3](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.17.3)

- **Fix: token refresh hang** — when the access token expired on a flaky network, the CLI no longer waits 5 minutes before failing; it now fails immediately with a clear error and preserves the token file for the next retry
- **`auth status` accuracy** — now shows three states: `valid` (green), `refresh pending` (yellow, access token expired but refresh token valid — next command auto-refreshes with no user action needed), `expired` (red, re-login required); previously `refresh pending` was incorrectly shown as `expired`
- **Fix: `--auth-code` login** — browser OAuth flow now triggers correctly when no token file exists
- **Fix: Windows browser launch** — OAuth URLs containing `&` parameters no longer get truncated on Windows; switched to the `open` crate for cross-platform browser launching

### [v0.17.1](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.17.1)

- **`completion` command** — generate shell tab-completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, elvish, and powershell; redirect stdout to the appropriate file then reload your shell to activate (e.g. `longbridge completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_longbridge`)
- Sets `User-Agent: longbridge-cli/<version>` on all HTTP and WebSocket requests
- Adds `x-cli-cmd` request header identifying the active subcommand on every API call

### [v0.17.0](https://github.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/releases/tag/v0.17.0)

- **`dca` command** — recurring investment plans: create, update, pause, resume, stop, view trade history, stats summary, check symbol eligibility, and calculate next trade date; HK/SG accounts must agree to Terms and Conditions before creating a plan (`--agree-terms` to skip the interactive prompt)
- **`sharelist` command** — community stock lists: list own and subscribed sharelists, browse trending lists (`popular`), create/delete sharelists, and add/remove/reorder constituent stocks
- **`short-positions`** — US stock short selling data: short ratio, short shares, average daily volume, days-to-cover, and close price; updated bi-monthly by FINRA; `--count` 1–100
- **`option volume`** — real-time call/put volume snapshot with put/call ratio; `daily` subcommand for historical call/put volume and open interest
- **`option chain`** — without `--date` now returns expiry dates only; pass `--date` to see strikes for a specific expiry
- **`profit-analysis`** — added `--start`/`--end` date filtering for the summary command; Simple Yield and TWR now shown as percentages; breakdown renamed from "Stock P&L Breakdown" to "P&L Breakdown" (includes funds and MMF)

### v0.16.3

- **`auth` subcommand group** — `longbridge auth login`, `auth logout`, `auth status`; `auth status` shows token validity, expiry, account info, and quote level locally without network
- **`alert enable` / `alert disable`** — toggle price alerts on/off without deleting them
- **Fix: US index symbols** — `.DJI.US`, `.VIX.US` and other US index symbols now parse correctly; US indexes require a leading dot (e.g. `.DJI.US`, not `DJI.US`)
- **"Did you mean?" hints** — when a query returns no data, the CLI suggests the correct symbol format: missing market suffix → `TSLA.US` / `700.HK`; missing leading dot → `.DJI.US`

### v0.16.1

**Enhancements**

- `option quote` — now returns all fields from the OptionQuote API (added `timestamp`, `trade_status`, `open_interest`, `historical_volatility`, `contract_multiplier`, `contract_size`, `direction`, `underlying_symbol`); JSON output uses proper typed values instead of table-column strings
- `calc-index` — Theta, Vega, and Rho values are now normalized (÷100) to standard per-share conventions; auto-detects option symbols and switches to Greeks default fields when stock defaults return empty
- `capital` — improved argument handling
- `market-status` — fixed incorrect `trade_status` mapping (105 = afternoon trading session); JSON output now returns human-readable market and status labels instead of raw API codes
- Parameter standardization: `--adjust none/forward` (was `no_adjust/forward_adjust`), `--tif day/gtc/gtd` (was `Day/GoodTilCanceled/GoodTilDate`), `--format table` as default name (alias: `pretty`), `finance-calendar --start/--end` (was `--date/--end-date`), `statement --start-date` now accepts `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- TUI: fixed watchlist sort jumping and made scrollbar more subtle
